The Power Dock is designed for use with a **3.7V LiPo Battery** with a standard 2-pin JST-PH connector (2mm spacing between pins).

Expect a 1500mAh battery to last about 10 hours, in some cases, up to 12 hours.

<!-- It should take Y hours to fully charge it up again.  -->

**Warning:** Do not attempt to charge your battery with anything other than the Power Dock or a charger designed specifically for LiPo Batteries!
