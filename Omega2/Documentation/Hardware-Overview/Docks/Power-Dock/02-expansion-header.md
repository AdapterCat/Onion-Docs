<!-- [//]: # (breakout of the Omega's GPIOs, can be connected to other circuits directly, or can use Omega expansions) -->

The Expansion Header is a convenient tool that gives you easy access to the Omega's GPIOs, and allows you to connect Onion Expansions directly. The Expansion Header is labelled to show you what GPIO is connected to each section.
