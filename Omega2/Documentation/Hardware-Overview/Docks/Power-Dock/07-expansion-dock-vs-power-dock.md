Note some of the differences between the Expansion Dock and the Power Dock:

![Hardware Differences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnionIoT/Onion-Docs/master/Omega2/Documentation/Hardware-Overview/img/power-dock-differences.jpg)

The main differences are:
  * Addition of battery management circuits and battery level indicator LEDs
  * Addition of 2-pin JST-PH connector for batteries
  * All circuit components are surface-mount
  * No USB-to-Serial Chip
  * No RGB LED
