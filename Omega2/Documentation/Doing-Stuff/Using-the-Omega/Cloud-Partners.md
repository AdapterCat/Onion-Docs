## Cloud Partners

In this section we would like to present you our Cloud Partners. So far, we are connected with Losant, Ubidots, IBM Watson IoT and Blynk. Please continue reading to find out further details and instructions on how to get started and proceed to a project making!

# Losant

Losant is a very powerful IoT Cloud Platform. Itâ€™s a great fit for making your Omega projects flexible, customizable and cloud-connected!

* [Getting Started with Losant](link)
* Example Projects
	* [Smart Plant]
Here is the link to their website where you can look up Omega2 and get started with Losant: https://www.losant.com/blog/getting-started-with-omega2-and-losant
We have created a Smart Plant project that involves sending datapoints to Losant and receiveing commands. Please refer to the part 2 of this project that covers in depth details on how to set up an account with Losant, create an application and send data points, [here is is](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/smart-plant-p2.html)
Once you've got familiar with their interface and get that Losant flavor, you may want to go further. Here is the link for our part 4 of this project that allows you to automate your watering system while you are out nad want to make sure your palnt watered enough: https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/smart-plant-p4.html

# Ubidots

Ubidots allows you to monitor sensor's data, process it and turn it into a user-friendly information. Use your Omega to automate your Cloud-Connected interface! First thing to get you an idea of what ubidots can do is to [create an account](https://app.ubidots.com/accounts/signup/) and add your Omega device.
Once you have signed up, you may want to see how it operates by following instruction from our [Project Book](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/ubidots-temperature-monitor.html)


# IBM Watson IoT

Now, that you have an idea what the Cloud Platform is, you may find out that there is a lot more platforms available. For example, self-speaking, [IBM Watson IoT](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/connect-an-onion-omega2-to-ibm-watson-iot-platform/)
We have also worked with their invention and created our own [Weather Station](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/weather-station.html) IoT based project. 


# Blynk

With Blynk, you may control your IoT device, in this case Omega2, with your smartphone! For Omega2, there is a Blynk library that is available that comes as a NodeJS module and can be installed using OPKG.
